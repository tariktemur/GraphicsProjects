# GraphicsProjects
Projects I've worked on as part of a computer graphics course I took. 

### Ray Tracing Project --

C++ implementation of a basic ray tracer. 

Given a set of triangles, their color attributes, camera positions etc. in an xml file, 
the code parses the file and renders a 2D image of the scene. Some example inputs are included under /inputs.


### Forward Rendering Pipeline Project -- 

C++ implementations of Modeling Transformation, Viewing Transformation and Rasterization stages of the Forward Rendering Pipeline. Given a set of triangles, their color attributes, camera positions etc. in an xml file, the code parses the file and renders a 2D image of the scene. Clipping (using Liang-Barsky) and backface culling were also implemented. 

Here are some sample input/output files: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsdauvkjBqM6nFG0D2ALwiFPDTkL?e=g5C5vH
