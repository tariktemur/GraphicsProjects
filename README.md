# GraphicsProjects
Projects I've worked on as part of a computer graphics course I took. 

Ray Tracing Project --

C++ implementation of a basic ray tracer. 

Given a set of triangles, their color attributes, camera positions etc. in an xml file, 
the code parses the file and renders a 2D image of the scene. 


Forward Rendering Pipeline Project -- 

C++ implementations of Modeling Transformation, Viewing Transformation,
and Rasterization stages of the Forward Rendering Pipeline.

Given a set of triangles, their color attributes, camera positions etc. in an xml file, 
the code parses the file and renders a 2D image of the scene. 

Clipping (using Liang-Barsky) and backface culling were also implemented.
